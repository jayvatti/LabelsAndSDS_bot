<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 1)>Product Information< HEADING />
Accord XRT II herbicide is a broad spectrum, systemic, postemergence
herbicide with no soil residual activity. It is intended for control of annual and
perennial weeds and woody plants and brush. It is formulated as a water
soluble liquid containing surfactant; no additional surfactant is needed.
Time to Symptoms: The active ingredient in this product moves through the
plant from the point of foliage contact into the root system. Visible effects
on most annual weeds occur within two to four days, but on most perennial
weeds visible effects may not occur for seven days or more. Extremely cool
or cloudy weather following treatment may slow activity of this product and
delay development of visual symptoms. Visible effects are a gradual wilting
and yellowing of the plant that advances to complete browning of above
ground growth and deterioration of underground plant parts.
Stage of Weeds: Annual weeds are easiest to control when they are small.
Best control of most perennial weeds is obtained when treatment is made
at late growth stages approaching maturity or when translocation is mostly
down to the roots, i.e. autumn for perennial plants or woody plants.
Mode of Action: The active ingredient in this product inhibits an enzyme.
This enzyme is found only in plants and microorganisms that are essential
to forming specific amino acids.
Cultural Considerations: Reduced control may result when applications
are made to annual or perennial weeds that have been mowed, grazed,
or cut, and have not been allowed to regrow to the specified stage
for treatment.
Rainfastness: Heavy rainfall soon after application may wash off this
product from the foliage and a repeat application may be required for
adequate control.
No Soil Activity: Weeds must be emerged at the time of application to be
controlled by this product. Weeds germinating from seed after application
will not be controlled. Unemerged plants arising from unattached
underground rhizomes or rootstocks of perennials will not be affected by
the herbicide and will continue to grow.
Maximum Application Rates: The maximum application rates specified
in this label are given in units of volume, either fluid ounces, pints or
quarts, of this product per acre. The maximum allowed application
rates apply to this product combined with the use of any and all other
glyphosate-containing herbicides, either applied separately or in a tank
mix, on the basis of total pounds of glyphosate (acid equivalents) per
acre. If more than one glyphosate-containing product is applied to the
same site within the same year, ensure that the total of pounds acid
equivalent glyphosate does not exceed the maximum allowed. Do not
apply more than a total of 8 quarts (8 lb glyphosate acid) of this product
per acre per year.
<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 1)>Herbicide Resistance Management< HEADING />
Glyphosate, the active ingredient in this product, is a Group 9 herbicide
(inhibitor of EPSP synthase enzyme). Some naturally occurring weed
biotypes that are tolerant (resistant) to glyphosate may exist due to
genetic variability in a weed population. Where resistant biotypes exist,
the repeated use of herbicides with the same mode of action can lead to
the selection for resistant weeds. Certain agronomic practices reduce the
likelihood that resistant weed populations will develop, and can be utilized
to manage weed resistance once it occurs.
To delay the selection for glyphosate resistant weeds, use the following
practices:
Scout fields before and after application to detect weed escapes or
shifts in weed species.
Start with a clean field by applying a burndown herbicide or by tillage.
Control weeds early when they are small.
Add other herbicides, such as a selective and/or a residual herbicide,
and cultural practices, such as tillage or crop rotation, where
appropriate.
Use the application rate for the most difficult to control weed in the
field. Do not tank mix with other herbicides that reduce this product's
efficacy through antagonism or with ones that encourage application
rates of this product below those specified on this label.
Control weed escapes and prevent weeds from setting seeds.
Before moving from one site to another, clean equipment to minimize
the spread of weed seeds or plant parts.
Use new commercial seed that is as free of weed seed as possible.
Report any incidence of repeated non-performance of this product
against a particular weed species to the local retailer, county extension
agent, or Corteva representative.
Appropriate testing is needed to determine if a weed is resistant to
glyphosate. The following good agronomic practices can reduce the
spread of confirmed glyphosate-resistant biotypes:
Tank mix this product or apply it sequentially with an appropriately
labeled herbicide with a different mode of action to achieve control if a
naturally occurring resistant biotype is present in the field.
Cultural and mechanical control practices, such as crop rotation or
tillage, may also be used.
To control weed escapes, including resistant biotypes, before they set
seed, scout treated fields after applying this product.
Thoroughly clean equipment before leaving any site known to contain
resistant biotypes.
Because the presence of glyphosate resistance in weed populations is
difficult to detect prior to use, Corteva accepts no liability for any losses
that may result from the failure of this product to control glyphosate-
resistant weeds, to the extent permitted by law.

<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 2)>Spray Drift Management< HEADING />
Avoiding spray drift at the application site is the responsibility of the
applicator. The interaction of many equipment- and weather-related
factors determine the potential for spray drift. The applicator and the
grower are responsible for considering all these factors when making
decisions. The following drift management requirements must be
followed to avoid off-target drift movement from aerial applications to
agricultural field crops. These requirements do not apply to forestry
applications, public health uses or to applications using dry formulations.
The distance of the outermost nozzles on the boom must not exceed
3/4 the length of the wingspan or rotor.
Nozzles must always point backward parallel with the air stream and
never be pointed downwards more than 45 degrees.
Where states have more stringent regulations, they must be observed.
The applicator must be familiar with and take into account the information
covered in the Aerial Drift Reduction Advisory.
<BOLD>Aerial Drift Reduction Advisory</BOLD>
<BOLD>This section is advisory in nature and does not supersede the</BOLD>
<BOLD>mandatory label requirements.</BOLD>
Importance of Droplet Size: The most effective way to reduce drift
potential is to apply large droplets. The best drift management strategy
is to apply the largest droplets that provide sufficient coverage and
control. Applying larger droplets reduces drift potential, but will not
prevent adverse effects from drift if applications are made improperly, or
under unfavorable environmental conditions (see Wind, Temperature and
Humidity, and Temperature Inversions).
<BOLD>Controlling Droplet Size:</BOLD>
Volume - Use high flow rate nozzles to apply the highest practical spray
volume. Nozzles with higher rated flows produce larger droplets.
Pressure - Do not exceed the nozzle manufacturer's recommended
pressures. Use the lower spray pressures for the nozzle. Higher
pressure reduces droplet size and does not improve canopy
penetration. When higher flow rates are needed, use higher flow rate
nozzles instead of increasing pressure.
Number of nozzles Use the minimum number of nozzles that provide
uniform coverage.
Nozzle orientation Orienting nozzles so that the spray is parallel to
the airstream produces larger droplets than other orientations and is
the recommended practice. Significant deflection from horizontal will
reduce droplet size and increase drift potential.
Nozzle type Use a nozzle type that is designed for the intended
application. With most nozzle types, narrower spray angles produce
larger droplets. Consider using low-drift nozzles. Solid stream nozzles
oriented straight back produce the largest droplets and the lowest drift.
Boom Length: For some use patterns, reducing the effective boom
length to less than 3/4 of the wingspan or rotor length may further reduce
drift without reducing swath width.
Application Height: Applications must not be made at a height greater
than 10 feet above the top of the largest plants unless a greater height is
required for aircraft safety. Making applications at the lowest height that
is safe reduces exposure of droplets to evaporation and wind.
Swath Adjustment: When applications are made with a crosswind, the
swath will be displaced downwind. Therefore, on the up and downwind
edges of the field, the applicator must compensate for this displacement
by adjusting the path of the aircraft upwind. Swath adjustment distance
will increase, with increasing drift potential (higher wind, smaller
drops, etc.).
Wind: Drift potential is lowest between wind speeds of 2 to 10 mph.
However, many factors, including droplet size and equipment type,
determine drift potential at any given speed. Avoid application when
winds are below 2 mph due to variable wind direction and high inversion
potential. Note: Local terrain can influence wind patterns. Every
applicator should be familiar with local wind patterns and how they affect
spray drift.
Temperature and Humidity: When making applications in low relative
humidity, set up equipment to produce larger droplets to compensate
for evaporation. Droplet evaporation is most severe when conditions are
both hot and dry.
Temperature Inversions: Applications must not occur during a
temperature inversion because drift potential is high. Temperature
inversions restrict vertical air mixing, which causes small suspended
droplets to remain in a concentrated cloud. This cloud can move in
unpredictable directions due to the light variable winds common during
inversions. Temperature inversions are characterized by increasing
temperatures with altitude and are common on nights with limited cloud
cover and light to no wind. They begin to form as the sun sets and often
continue into the morning. Their presence can be indicated by ground
fog; however, if fog is not present, inversions can also be identified by the
movement of smoke from a ground source or an aircraft smoke generator.
Smoke that layers and moves laterally in a connected cloud (under low
wind conditions) indicates an inversion, while smoke that moves upwards
and rapidly dissipates indicates good vertical air mixing.
Sensitive Areas: The pesticide must only be applied when the potential
for drift to adjacent sensitive areas (e.g., residential areas, bodies of water,
known habitat for threatened or endangered species, non-target crops) is
minimal (e.g., when wind is blowing away from the sensitive areas).

agitators, terminate by-pass and return lines at the bottom of the tank
and, if needed, use an approved anti-foam or defoaming agent.
Accord XRT II - Tank Mixing for use on any site listed on this label
This product does not provide residual weed control. For residual weed
control or to broaden the weed control spectrum, tank mix this product
with other herbicides. It is the pesticide user's responsibility to ensure
that all products are registered for the intended use. Read and follow the
applicable restrictions and limitations and directions for use on all product
labels involved in tank mixing. Users must follow the most restrictive
directions for use and precautionary statements of each product in the
tank mixture. A compatibility test may be done prior to using a product
that has not been tank mixed before with Accord XRT Il in your program.
See testing procedure below.
The user is responsible for ensuring that the specific application being
made is included on the label of the product used in the tank mix and
is compatible with Accord XRT II, especially if using a generic product
with active ingredients, such as 2,4-D, atrazine, dicamba, diuron,
pendimethalin or other herbicide, is listed in the label.
Add the tank mix product to the tank as directed by the label. Maintain
agitation and add the required amount of this product. Maintain good
agitation at all times until the contents in the tank are sprayed. If the
<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 2)>Specimen Label Revised 01-06-23< HEADING />
3
mixture is allowed to settle, thorough agitation is required to resuspend
the mixture before spraying resumes. Keep the bypass line on or near the
bottom of the tank to minimize foaming. The screen size in the nozzle or
line strainers must be no finer than 50 mesh.
Tank Mix Compatibility Testing: Perform a jar test prior to mixing in a
spray tank to ensure compatibility of Accord XRT II and other pesticides
or carriers. Use a clear glass jar with lid and mix ingredients in the same
order and proportions as will be used in the spray tank. The mixture is
compatible if the materials mix readily when the jar is inverted several
times. The mixture should remain stable after standing for 1/2 hour or,
if separation occurs, should readily remix if agitated. An incompatible
mixture is indicated by separation into distinct layers that do not readily
remix when agitated and/or the presence of flakes, precipitates, gels,
or heavy oily film in the jar. Use of an appropriate compatibility aid may
resolve mix incompatibility. If the mixture is incompatible do not use that
tank mix partner in tank mixtures.
Note: If tank mixing with a product containing triclopyn amine, such as
Garlon® 3A herbicide or Capstone, ensure that the triclopyr amine product
is well mixed with at least 75 percent of the total spray volume before
adding this product to the spray tank to avoid incompatibility.
To the extent consistent with applicable law, buyer and all users are
responsible for all loss or damage in connection with the use or handling

product is limited to pilots who have successfully completed a Fresno
County Agricultural Commissioner and California Department of
Pesticide Regulation approved training program for aerial application of
herbicides. All aircraft must be inspected, critiqued in flight and certified
at a Fresno County Agricultural Commissioner approved fly-in. To insure
that proper rates of herbicides and adjuvants are being applied during
commercial use, test and calibrate the spray equipment at appropriate
intervals. Demonstration of performance at Fresno County Agricultural
Commissioner approved fly-ins constitutes such documentation, or
other written records showing calculations and measurements of flight
and spray parameters acceptable to the Fresno County Agricultural
Commissioner.
Applications at Night: Do not aerially apply this product earlier than
30 minutes prior to sunrise and/or later than 30 minutes after sunset.
Doing so requires prior permission from the Fresno County Agricultural
Commissioner.
<BOLD>Ground Application</BOLD>
Apply the specified rates of this product in 3 to 40 gpa of water as a
broadcast spray unless otherwise specified on this label. Increase the
spray volume within the rate range as density of weeds increases to
ensure complete coverage. In order not to spray a fine mist, carefully
select proper nozzles. Use flat fan nozzles for best results with ground
application equipment. Check spray pattern for uniform distribution of
spray droplets.
<BOLD>Handheld and Backpack Application</BOLD>
Apply to foliage of vegetation to be controlled. Do not spray to the point
of runoff for applications made on a spray to wet basis. Use coarse
sprays only. For low volume directed spray applications, spray coverage
should be uniform with at least 50 percent of the foliage contacted. For
best results, cover the top one-half of the plant. To ensure adequate
spray coverage, spray both sides of large or tall woody brush and trees,
when foliage is thick and dense, or where there are multiple sprouts.

<BOLD>Selective Equipment</BOLD>
This product may be diluted with water and applied through shielded
applicators, hooded sprayers, wiper applicators or sponge bars to weeds
listed on this label. Avoid contact of herbicide with desirable vegetation
as serious injury or death is likely to occur.
Adjust application equipment used above desired vegetation so that
the lowest spray stream or wiper contact is at least 2 inches above the
desirable vegetation. Droplets, mist, foam, or splatter of the herbicide
settling on desirable vegetation is likely to result in discoloration, stunting
or destruction.
Better results are obtained when more of the weed is exposed to the
herbicide solution. Weeds not contacted by the herbicide solution will
not be affected. This may occur in dense clumps, severe infestations, or
when the height of weeds varies so that not all weeds are contacted. If
this occurs, repeat treatment may be necessary.
<BOLD>Shielded and Hooded Applicators</BOLD>
A shielded or hooded applicator directs the herbicide solution onto weeds
while shielding desirable vegetation from the herbicide. A hooded sprayer
is a shielded sprayer in which the spray pattern is totally enclosed,
including the top, sides, front, and back. Use nozzles that provide uniform
coverage within the treated area. Keep shields on these sprayers adjusted
to protect desirable vegetation. Exercise extreme care to avoid contact
<BOLD>of herbicide with desirable vegetation.</BOLD>
<BOLD>Wiper Applicators</BOLD>
Wiper applicators are devices that physically wipe appropriate amounts
of this product directly onto the weed. Equipment must be designed,
maintained and operated to prevent the herbicide solution from contacting
desirable vegetation.
Adjust application equipment used over the top of desirable vegetation
so that the wiper contact point is at least 2 inches above the desirable
vegetation. Better results are obtained when more of the weed is exposed
to the herbicide solution. Weeds should be a minimum of 6 inches above
the desirable vegetation. Adjust the applicator height to ensure adequate
contact with weeds as weeds not contacted by the herbicide solution
will not be affected. Poor contact may occur when weeds are growing in
dense clumps, in severe weed infestations, or when weed height varies
dramatically. If this occurs, repeat treatment may be necessary.
Operate this equipment at ground speeds no more than 5 mph.
Performance may be improved by reducing speed in areas of heavy weed
infestations to ensure adequate wiper saturation. Better results may be
obtained if two applications are made in opposite directions.
Droplets, mist, foam, or splatter of the herbicide settling onto desirable
vegetation may result in discoloration, stunting or destruction. Avoid
leakage or dripping onto desirable vegetation. Adjust height of applicator
to ensure adequate contact with weeds. Keep wiping surfaces clean. Be
aware that on sloping ground the herbicide solution may migrate, causing
dripping on the lower end and drying of the wicks on the upper end of a
wiper applicator.
Do not use wiper equipment when weeds are wet.
Mix only the amount of solution to be used during a one-day period as
reduced activity may result from use of leftover solutions. Clean wiper
parts by thoroughly flushing with water immediately after using this
product.
<BOLD>Rope or Sponge Wick Applicators</BOLD>
Use 25 to 70 percent solutions of this product in water.

<BOLD>Turfgrass Renovation, Seed, or Sod Production</BOLD>
This product controls most existing vegetation prior to renovating
turfgrass areas or establishing turfgrass grown for seed or sod. For
maximum control of existing vegetation, delay planting or sodding
to determine if any regrowth from escaped underground plant parts
occurs. When repeat treatments are necessary, sufficient regrowth
must be attained prior to application. For warm season turfgrass,
such as bermudagrass, summer or fall applications provide the best
control. Where existing vegetation is growing under mowed turfgrass
management, apply this product after omitting at least one regular
mowing to allow sufficient growth for good interception of the spray.
Desirable turfgrass may be planted following the above procedures.
Handheld equipment may be used for spot treatment of unwanted
vegetation growing in existing turfgrass. Use broadcast or handheld
equipment to control sod remnants or other unwanted vegetation after
sod is harvested.
<BOLD>Restrictions:</BOLD>
Do not disturb soil or underground plant parts before treatment.
Delay tillage or renovation techniques, such as vertical mowing, coring
or slicing, for seven days after application to allow translocation into
underground plant parts.

height (DBH). This is best achieved by applying a 50 to 100 percent
concentration of this product either to a continuous frill around the
tree or as cuts evenly spaced around the tree below all branches. As
tree diameter increases in size, better results are achieved by applying
diluted material to a continuous frill or more closely spaced cuttings. Do
not make any applications that allow runoff to occur from frilled or cut
areas in species that exude sap freely. In species such as this, make
the frill or cuts at an oblique angle to produce a cupping effect and use
a 100 percent undiluted concentration of this product. For best results,
apply during periods of active growth and after full leaf expansion. This
product controls many species; some of these species are listed below.

timothy, and wheatgrass, to control these species prior to replanting.
<BOLD>Restrictions:</BOLD>
If the application rate used is 2.25 quarts or less per acre, no waiting
period is required between treatment and feeding or grazing livestock.
If the application rate used is more than 2.25 quarts per acre, remove
livestock before applying this product and wait 8 weeks after applying
before resuming grazing or harvesting.
<BOLD>Spot Treatment and Wiper Applicator</BOLD>
To control tall weeds, apply this product in pastures as a spot treatment
or over the top of desirable grasses using a wiper applicator. Repeat
applications may be made in the same area every 30 days.
Restrictions:
The entire pasture or any portion of it may be treated when using
2.25 quarts or less of this product per acre for spot treatments or wiper
applications.
No more than 10 percent of the total pasture may be treated at any one
time when using more than 2.25 quarts of this product per acre for spot
treatments or wiper applications.
To achieve maximum performance, remove domestic livestock before
application and wait 7 days after application before grazing livestock or
harvesting for feed.
<BOLD>Selective Weed Control in Dormant Pastures</BOLD>
Apply this product to dormant pastures to suppress competitive growth
and seed production of annual weeds and undesirable vegetation. Apply
9 to 12 fl OZ of this product per acre by broadcast application equipment.
Apply in early spring before desirable perennial grasses break dormancy
and initiate green growth, or in late fall after desirable perennial grasses
have reached dormancy.
Restrictions:
If this product is applied when plants are not dormant, some stunting of
perennial grasses will occur.
Using a higher rate in the rate range could cause stand reduction.
Do not apply more than a total of 2.25 quarts of this product per acre
per year to pasture grasses except for renovation use.
There is no waiting period between application and grazing or harvesting.
<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 7)>Rangelands< HEADING />
Apply 2.5 lb ai per acre to control or suppress many annual weeds
growing in perennial cool and warm season grass rangelands, and
pastures. Preventing weed seed production is critical to the successful
control of annual grassy weeds invading these perennial grass sites.
Eliminate most of the viable seeds with follow up applications in
sequential years. Delay grazing of treated areas to encourage growth of
desirable perennials. Allowing desirable perennials to flower and reseed
in the treated area will encourage successful transition.
Bromus: Use this product to control or suppress downy brome (Bromus
tectorum), Japanese brome (Bromus japonicus), soft chess (Bromus
mollis), cheatgrass (Bromus secalinus), cereal rye and jointed goatgrass
found in rangelands, and pastures. Apply 6 to 12 fl OZ of this product per
acre as a broadcast treatment.
For best results, coincide treatments with early seedhead emergence
of the most mature plants. Delaying the application until this growth
stage maximizes the emergence of other weedy grass flushes. Make
applications to the same site each year until seed banks are depleted and
the desirable perennial grasses become established on the site.
Medusahead: Apply 12 fl OZ of this product per acre to control or
suppress medusahead at the 3-leaf stage when plants are actively
growing. Delaying applications beyond this stage results in reduced
or unacceptable control. Repeat applications in subsequent years to
eliminate the seedbank before reestablishing desirable perennial grasses.
Apply in the fall or spring.
Apply by ground or air. Make aerial applications for these uses with fixed
wing or helicopter equipment. For aerial applications, apply in 2 to 10 gpa
of water. For ground applications, apply in 10 to 20 gpa of water.
<BOLD>Spot Treatment Wiper Application</BOLD>
Apply this product in rangeland, and pastures as a spot treatment or over
the top of desirable grasses using wiper applicators to control tall weeds.
Make repeat applications in the same area at 30-day intervals.
Restrictions:
The entire site or any portion of it may be treated when using 2.25 quarts
or less of this product per acre for spot treatments or wiper applications.
No more than 10 percent of the total site may be treated at any one
time when using more than 2.25 quarts of this product per acre for spot
treatments or wiper applications.
To achieve maximum performance, remove domestic livestock before
application and wait 7 days after application before grazing livestock or
harvesting for feed.
<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 7)>Weeds< HEADING />
Use a higher rate in the rate range when weed growth is heavy, dense, or
growing in an undisturbed (non-cultivated) area. The performance of this
product may be reduced when applying to weeds heavily covered with
dust. If weeds have been mowed, grazed, or cut, allow regrowth to occur
before applying this product.
If a handheld sprayer is used to apply this product on a spray to wet
technique, ensure that the spray coverage is uniform and complete,
<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 7)>Specimen Label Revised 01-06-23< HEADING />
8
and at least 50 percent of the foliage, or the top one-half of the plant, is
sprayed. Spray both sides of large or tall weeds, thick or dense foliage, or
multiple sprouts in order to ensure complete coverage.
After applying this product, if the soil must be tilled or the weeds mowed,
wait 7 days before tilling, mowing, or removing residual vegetation to
allow translocation of this product into underground plant parts.
Apply 1 to 1.75 gallons of this product per acre for enhanced results to
control tough to control perennial weeds, woody brush and trees, plants
growing under stressed conditions, or in areas of dense vegetation.
<BOLD>See Tank Mixing section above for more information.</BOLD>
Note: If tank mixing with a product containing triclopyr amine, such as
Garlon® 3A herbicide or Capstone, ensure that the triclopyr amine product
is well mixed with at least 75 percent of the total spray volume before
adding this product to the spray tank to avoid incompatibility.
<BOLD>Annual Weeds</BOLD>
Apply 1.5 pints of this product per acre if weeds are less than 6 inches in
height or runner length. Use 1.25 to 3 quarts of this product per acre if
weeds are more than 6 inches in height or runner length, or when weeds
are growing under stressed conditions. Use a higher rate in the rate
range for tough to control species regardless of the size of the weed at
the time of application. Treat tough to control weeds early when they are
relatively small.
Apply a 0.4 percent solution of this product as a spray to wet application
to weeds less than 6 inches in height or runner length. Use a 0.7 to
1.5 percent solution for annual weeds more than 6 inches tall or for any
weeds growing under stressed conditions. Use the higher concentration
for tough to control species or for weeds more than 24 inches tall. Apply
prior to seedhead formation in grass or bud formation in broadleaf weeds.
Use a 4 to 7 percent solution of this product for low volume directed spray
applications.

<BOLD>Perennial Weeds</BOLD>
Best results are obtained when perennial weeds are treated after they
reach the reproductive stage of growth (seedhead initiation in grasses
and bud formation in broadleaves). Best results are obtained when
non-flowering plants are treated when they reach a mature stage of
growth. In many situations, applications are required prior to these growth
stages. Under these conditions, use a higher rate in the rate range.
When using spray to wet treatments with handheld equipment, ensure
thorough coverage of the plant. For best results, use a 1.5 percent
solution on harder to control perennials, such as bermudagrass, dock,
field bindweed, hemp dogbane, milkweed and Canada thistle.
Use a 4 to 7 percent solution of this product in low volume directed spray
applications.

34 fl OZ of Envoy per acre in 20 to 40 gpa of spray solution.
1.5 pints of Fusilade Il per acre in 20 to 40 gpa of spray solution.
3.75 pints of Vantage per acre in 20 to 40 gpa of spray solution.
9 fl OZ of Fusion per acre in 20 to 40 gpa of spray solution.
In the event of incomplete control, re-treatment may be necessary.
Spot Treatment: Mix 2 fl OZ of this product with
1.3 fl OZ of Envoy in 1 gallon of water and spray to wet.
0.75 fl OZ of Fusilade II in 1 gallon of water and spray to wet.
3 fl OZ of Vantage in 1 gallon of water and spray to wet.
0.25 fl OZ of Fusion in 1 gallon of water and spray to wet.
Attention: Avoid drift. Use extreme care when applying this product to
prevent injury to desirable plants and crops.
<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 9)>Woody Brush and Trees< HEADING />
Apply this product after full leaf expansion unless otherwise directed.
Use the higher rate in the rate range for larger plants and/or dense areas
of growth. On vines, use the higher rate in the rate range for plants that
have reached the woody stage of growth. Best results are obtained when
application is made in late summer or fall after fruit formation.
In arid areas, best results are obtained when applications are made in the
spring to early summer when brush species are at high moisture content
and are flowering.
Use a 1.5 percent solution when applying this product using a spray to
wet technique with a handheld sprayer on harder to control woody brush
and trees.
Apply a 4 to 7 percent solution of this product for low volume directed
spray applications.
Some autumn colors on undesirable deciduous species are acceptable
provided no major leaf drop has occurred. Reduced performance may
result if fall treatments are made following a frost. Herbicidal symptoms
might not appear prior to frost or senescence following a fall application.
Repeat treatments may be necessary to control plants regenerating from
underground parts or seed.
<BOLD>See Tank Mixing section above for more information.</BOLD>
Note: If tank mixing with a product containing triclopyr amine, such as
Garlon® 3A herbicide or Capstone, ensure that the triclopyr amine product
