<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 2)>Product Information< HEADING />
Embed Extra herbicide is intended for selective control of many broadleaf
weeds in asparagus; blueberries, high bush; cereal grains; cranberries;
grasses (turf) for seed or sod; orchard floors (pome fruit, including apples
and pears, stone fruit and nut orchards); fallowland and crop stubble;
filberts; sugarcane; and strawberries (established planting only).
Apply Embed Extra as a water or oil-water spray during warm weather
when target weeds or woody plants are actively growing. Application
under drought conditions will often give poor results. Use low spray
pressure to minimize drift. Generally, the lower dosages specified on this
label will be satisfactory for young, succulent growth of susceptible weed
species. For less susceptible species and under conditions where control
is more difficult, use higher specified rates. Deep-rooted perennial weeds
such as Canada thistle and field bindweed and many woody plants usually
require repeated applications for satisfactory control. Consult your State
Agricultural Experiment stations or Extension Service Weed Specialists for
recommendations from this label that best fit local conditions.
When this product is applied as directed and under the circumstances
described, it controls annual and perennial broadleaf weeds listed in
this label.
Time to Symptoms on Susceptible Plants: Initial symptoms include
drooping leaves and epinasty, which typically occurs within 24 hours of
foliar treatment. This is followed by chlorosis, necrosis, further leaf/stem
malformation and, growth inhibition. Complete death and desiccation of
susceptible plants occurs within 3-5 weeks.
Stage of Broadleaf Weeds: Annual weeds are easiest to control when
they are small. Best control of most perennial weeds is obtained when
treatment is made at late growth stages approaching maturity. Refer to
the annual and perennial rate tables for specific weeds. When treating
weeds with disease or insect damage, weeds heavily covered with
dust, or weeds under poor growing conditions, reduced weed control
may result.
Rainfastness: Heavy rainfall soon after application may wash off this
product from the foliage.
Spray Coverage: For best results, spray coverage should be uniform and
complete. Do not spray weed foliage to the point of runoff.
Mode of Action: 2,4-D, the active ingredient in this product, mimics the
naturally occurring plant auxins and overloads the plant's auxin balance
affecting vital processes, such as cell division and elongation, resulting in
abnormal growth and plant death.
Limited Soil Activity: Though some suppression of annual weeds
emerging soon after application may occur when this product is applied
at higher rates within the rate range, optimum control is achieved when
the majority of weeds are emerged at the time of application. Unemerged
plants arising from unattached underground rhizomes or rootstocks of
perennials will not be affected by the herbicide and will continue to grow.
Biological Degradation: Degradation of this product is primarily a
biological process carried out by soil microbes.
<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 2)>Herbicide Resistance Management< HEADING />
2,4-D, the active ingredient in this product, is a Group 4 herbicide
(synthetic auxin). Weed populations may develop biotypes that are
resistant to different herbicides with the same mode of action. If
herbicides with the same mode of action are used repeatedly in the
same field, resistant biotypes may eventually develop, produce viable
seed, dominate the weed population and may not be controlled by this
product. Other resistance mechanisms, such as biotypes with enhanced
herbicide metabolism, may also develop, exist in a field and may cause
reduced weed control. Some naturally occurring weed biotypes that are
tolerant (resistant) to 2,4-D may exist due to genetic variability in a weed
population. Where resistant biotypes exist, the repeated use of herbicides
with the same mode of action can lead to the selection for resistant
weeds. Certain agronomic practices reduce the likelihood that resistant
weed populations will develop and can be utilized to manage weed
resistance once it occurs.
Suspected herbicide-resistant weeds may be identified by
these indicators:
Failure to control a weeds species normally controlled by the herbicide
at the dose applied, especially if control is achieved on adjacent weeds;
A spreading patch of non-controlled plants of a particular weed
species; and
Surviving plants mixed with controlled individuals of the same species.
This product should be used as part of an Integrated Pest Management
(IPM) program that may include biological, cultural, and chemical
practices aimed at preventing economic pest damage. Application of this
product should be based on appropriate IPM and resistance management
strategies and practices that delay or reduce the development of
herbicide-resistant weed biotypes. Such practices include, but are not
limited to, field scouting, use of weed free crop seed, cultural practices
including burndown herbicides, crop rotation and cultivation, proper
water management, correct weed pest identification, following rotational
practices outlined on pesticide labels, and treating with the correct
product rates when target weed populations are at the correct stage and
economic thresholds for control.
To aid in the prevention of developing 2,4-D resistant weeds,
Corteva Agriscience recommends the following practices:
2
<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 2)>Specimen Label Revised 01-04-24< HEADING />
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 3)>Herbicide Selection:</BOLD>
Rotate the use of 2,4-D with non-auxin (non-Group 4) herbicides.
Utilize a broad spectrum soil-applied herbicide as a
foundation treatment.
Utilize tank mixes or sequential applications of herbicides with
alternative modes of action.
Avoid using more than two applications of a Group 4 herbicide, such
as 2,4-D, within a single growing season unless mixed with another
mode of action herbicide with overlapping spectrum.
Apply full rates of 2,4-D at the specified time (correct weed size) to
minimize escapes of tolerant weeds.
Fields should be scouted prior to application to identify the weed
species present and their growth stage to determine if the intended
application will be effective.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 3)>Crop Selection and Cultural Practices:</BOLD>
Incorporate additional weed control practices whenever possible, such
as mechanical cultivation, delayed planting, crop rotation, and weed-
free crop seeds, as part of an integrated weed control program.
Do not allow weed escapes to produce seeds, roots or tubers.
Thoroughly clean plant residues from equipment before leaving fields
suspected to contain resistant weeds.
Scout fields after application to detect weed escapes or shifts in
weed species.
If resistance is suspected, treat weed escapes with an alternate mode
of action or cultivation.
Report any incidence of repeated non-performance of this product
against a particular weed species to the local retailer, county extension
agent, or Corteva Agriscience representative.
Because the presence of herbicide resistance in weed populations is
difficult to detect prior to use to the extent consistent with applicable law,
Corteva Agriscience accepts no liability for any losses that may result
from the failure of this product to control weeds resistant to this mode of
action. Report incidents of non-performance to the local retailer, county
extension agent, or Corteva Agriscience representative.
<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 3)>Spray Drift Management< HEADING />
A variety of factors including weather conditions (e.g., wind direction, wind
speed, temperature, and relative humidity) and method of application
(e.g., ground, aerial, airblast) can influence pesticide drift. The applicator
must evaluate all factors and make appropriate adjustments when
applying this product.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 3)>Droplet Size</BOLD>
When applying sprays that contain 2,4-D as the sole active ingredient,
or when applying sprays that contain 2,4-D mixed with other active
ingredients that require a coarse or coarser spray, apply only as a coarse
or coarser spray (ASABE S-572 standard) or a volume mean diameter
of 385 microns or greater for spinning atomizer nozzles.
When applying sprays that contain 2,4-D mixed with other active
ingredients that require a medium or finer spray, apply only as a medium
or coarser spray (ASABE Standard 572) or a volume mean diameter
of 300 microns or greater for spinning atomizer nozzles.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 3)>Wind Speed</BOLD>
Do not apply at wind speeds greater than 15 mph. Only apply this
product if the wind direction favors on-target deposition and there are not
sensitive areas (including residential areas, bodies of water, known habitat
for non-target species, non-target crops) within 250 feet downwind. If
applying a medium droplet spray, leave one swath unsprayed at the
downwind edge of the treated field.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 3)>Temperature Inversions</BOLD>
Applications should not occur during a local, low level temperature inversion
because drift potential is high. Temperature inversions restrict vertical air
mixing, which causes small suspended droplets to remain in a concentrated
cloud. This cloud can move in unpredictable directions due to the light
variable winds common during inversions. Temperature inversions are
characterized by increasing temperatures with altitude and are common on
nights with limited cloud cover and light to no wind. They begin to form as
the sun sets and often continue into the morning. Their presence can be
indicated by ground fog; however, if fog is not present, inversions can also
be identified by the movement of the smoke from a ground source generator.
Smoke that layers and moves laterally in a concentrated cloud (under low
wind conditions) indicates an inversion, while smoke that moves upward and
rapidly dissipates indicates good vertical air mixing.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 3)>State and Local Requirements</BOLD>
Applicators must follow all state and local pesticide drift requirements
regarding application of 2,4-D herbicides. Where states have more
stringent regulations, they must be observed.
<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 3)>Susceptible Plants< HEADING />
Do not apply under circumstances where spray drift may occur to food,
forage, or other plantings that might be damaged or crops thereof
rendered unfit for sale, use or consumption. Do not allow contact of
herbicide with foliage of desirable plants; including cotton and trees,
because severe injury or destruction may result. Small amounts of spray
drift that may not be visible may injure susceptible broadleaf plants.

<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 3)>Application Equipment and Application Methods {['TITLE EXTRACT']}< HEADING />
Chemigation: Do not apply this product through any type of
irrigation system.
Apply Embed Extra with the following application equipment: Apply spray
solutions in properly maintained and calibrated equipment capable of
delivering desired volumes.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 3)>Ground Broadcast Spray</BOLD>
Boom, pull-type sprayer, floaters, pick-up sprayers, spray coupes and
other ground broadcast equipment. Use the minimum boom height
based upon the nozzle manufacturer's specifications. Spray drift potential
is increased as boom height increases. Spray drift can be minimized
if nozzle height is not greater than maximum height recommended by
nozzle manufacturer for the nozzle selected.
Use the specified rates of this product as a broadcast spray unless
otherwise specified. As the density of weeds increases, increase spray
volume within the specified range to ensure complete coverage. Check for
even distribution of spray droplets.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 3)>Aerial Application</BOLD>
The boom length must not exceed 75% of the wingspan or 90% of the
rotor blade diameter.
Release spray at the lowest height consistent with efficacy and flight
safety. Do not release spray at a height greater than 10 feet above the
crop canopy unless a greater height is required for aircraft safety. This
requirement does not apply to forestry or rights-of-way applications.
When applications are made with a crosswind, the swath will be displaced
downwind. The applicator must compensate for this by adjusting the
path of the aircraft upwind.
<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 3)>Mixing Directions< HEADING />
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 3)>Embed Extra - Alone</BOLD>
Mix Embed Extra only with water unless otherwise directed on this label.
Add about half of the water to the mixing tank, then add Embed Extra with
agitation, and finally the rest of the water with continuing agitation. Note:
Adding oil, wetting agent, or other surfactant to the spray mixture may
increase effectiveness on weeds, but also may reduce selectivity to crops
resulting in crop damage.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 3)>Embed Extra Tank Mix</BOLD>
When tank mixing, read and follow the label of each tank mix product
used for precautionary statements, directions for use, weeds controlled,
and geographic and other restrictions. Use in accordance with the
most restrictive of label limitations and precautions. Do not exceed any
active ingredient's maximum use rates when tank mixing. Do not tank
mix this product with any product containing a label prohibition against
tank mixing with 2,4-D. It is the pesticide user's responsibility to ensure
that all products are registered for the intended use. Read and follow the
applicable restrictions and limitations and directions for use on all product
labels involved in tank mixing. Users must follow the most restrictive
directions for use and precautionary statements of each product in the
tank mixture.
Tank Mix Compatibility Testing: A jar test is recommended prior to tank
mixing to ensure compatibility of this product and other pesticides. Use
a clear glass quart jar with lid and mix the tank mix ingredients in their
relative proportions. Invert the jar containing the mixture several times
and observe the mixture for approximately 1/2 hour. If the mixture balls-up,
forms flakes, sludges, jels, oily films or layers, or other precipitates, it is
not compatible and the tank mix combination should not be used.
Mixing with Liquid Nitrogen Fertilizer: This product may be combined
with liquid nitrogen fertilizer suitable for foliar application to accomplish
broadleaf weed control and fertilization of small grains in a single
operation. Use Embed Extra in accordance with directions for these
crops provided in this label. Use liquid fertilizer at rates specified by the
supplier or Extension Service Specialist. Test for mixing compatibility as
described above before mixing in a spray tank. A compatibility aid such
as Unite or Complex may be needed in some situations. Compatibility
is best with liquid fertilizer solutions containing only nitrogen. Mixing
with N-P-K solutions may not be satisfactory, even with the addition of a
compatibility aid. Pre-mixing 1 part Embed Extra with up to 4 parts water
may help in situations when mixing difficulty occurs.

<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 3)>Specimen Label Revised 01-04-24< HEADING />
Fill the tank about half full with the liquid fertilizer, then add the required
amount of Embed Extra with agitation. Maintain agitation and complete
filling the tank with liquid fertilizer. Apply immediately and continue
agitation in spray tank during application. Do not store the spray mixture.
Application during very cold weather (near freezing) is not advisable.

and clean them separately.
<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 4)>Application Directions< HEADING />
Apply with calibrated air or ground equipment using sufficient spray
volume to provide adequate coverage of target weeds or as otherwise
directed in Use Directions. For broadcast application, use a spray
volume of 3 gallons or more per acre by air and 10 gallons or more per
acre for ground equipment. Where states have regulations which specify
minimum spray volumes, they must be observed. In general, increase
spray volume as crop canopy, height and weed density increase in order
to obtain adequate spray coverage. Do not apply less than 3 gallons
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 4)>total spray volume per acre.</BOLD>
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 4)>Application Rate</BOLD>
The lower dosages given will be satisfactory for young, succulent
growth of sensitive weed species. For less sensitive species and
under conditions where control is more difficult, the higher dosages
will be needed.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 4)>Application Timing</BOLD>
Apply Embed Extra during warm weather when weeds are young and
actively growing.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 4)>Spot Treatments</BOLD>
To prevent misapplication, apply spot treatments with a calibrated boom
or with hand sprayers using a fixed spray volume per 1000 sq ft as
indicated below.
Hand-Held Sprayers: Hand-held sprayers may be used for spot
applications of Embed Extra. Take care to apply the spray uniformly and
at a rate equivalent to a broadcast application. Application rates in the
table are based upon the application rate for an area of 1000 sq ft. Mix
the amount of Embed Extra (fl OZ or mL) corresponding to the desired
broadcast rate in 1 to 3 gallons of spray. To calculate the amount of
Embed Extra required for larger areas, multiply the table value (fl OZ or
mL) by the thousands of sq ft to be treated. An area of 1000 sq ft is
approximately 10.5 X 10.5 yards (strides) in size.

<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 7)>Planting in Treated Areas</BOLD>
Labeled Crops: Within 29 days following an application of this product, plant only those crops named as use sites on this or other registered 2,4-D
labels. Follow more specific limitations, if any, provided in the directions for individual crops. Labeled crops may be at risk for crop injury or loss when
planted soon after application, especially in the first 14 days. Degradation factors described below should be considered in weighing this risk.
Other Crops: All other crops may be planted 30 or more days following an application without concern for illegal residues in the planted crop.
However, under certain conditions, there may be a risk of injury to susceptible crops. Degradation factors described below should be considered in
weighing this risk. Under normal conditions, any crop may be planted without risk of injury if at least 90 days of soil temperatures above freezing have
elapsed since application.
Degradation Factors: When planting into treated areas, the risk of crop injury is less if lower rates of product were applied and conditions following
application have included warm, moist soil conditions that favor rapid degradation of 2,4-D. Risk is greater if higher rates of product were applied and
soil temperatures have been cold and/or soils have been excessively wet or dry in the days following application.
