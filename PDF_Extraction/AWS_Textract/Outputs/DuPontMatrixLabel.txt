product information
duponttm matrix® sg herbicide is a water soluble granule formulation that selectively controls certain broadleaf weeds
and grasses in pome fruit, citrus fruit, tree nuts, stone fruit and grape crops which have been established for at least one full
growing season. matrix® sg herbicide also selectively controls certain broadleaf weeds and grasses in field corn (ca
only), potatoes, potatoes grown for seed, and field grown tomatoes (direct seeded and transplant).
the best control is obtained when matrix® sg is applied to young, actively growing weeds. the degree and duration of
control may depend on the following:
weed spectrum and infestation intensity
weed size at application
environmental conditions at and following treatment
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 3)>biological activity and environmental conditions</BOLD>
matrix® sg is absorbed through the roots and foliage of plants, rapidly inhibiting the growth of susceptible weeds. for
preemergence weed control, rainfall or sprinkler irrigation is needed to move matrix® sg into the soil. weeds will
generally not emerge from preemergence applications. in some cases, susceptible weeds may germinate and emerge a few
days after application, but growth then ceases and leaves become chlorotic three to five days after emergence. death of leaf
tissue and growing point will follow in some species, while others will remain green but stunted and noncompetitive.
one to three weeks after postemergence application to weeds, leaves of susceptible plants appear chlorotic, and the
growing point subsequently dies. in warm, moist conditions, the expression of herbicide symptoms is accelerated; in cold,
dry conditions, expression of herbicide symptoms is delayed. death of leaf tissue and growing point will follow in some
species, while others will remain green but stunted and noncompetitive.
matrix® sg provides the best control of weeds in vigorously growing crops that shade competitive weeds. weed
control in areas of thin crop stand or seeding skips may not provide satisfactory control. however, a crop canopy that is too
dense at application can intercept spray and reduce weed control.
the herbicidal action of matrix® sg may be less effective on weeds stressed from adverse environmental conditions
(including extreme temperatures or moisture), abnormal soil conditions, or cultural practices. in addition, weeds hardened-
off by drought stress are less susceptible to matrix® sg.
postemergence weed control may be reduced if rainfall occurs soon after application. several hours of dry weather are
needed to allow matrix® sg to be sufficiently absorbed by weed foliage (generally matrix® sg is rainfast in
4
hours).
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 3)>precautions</BOLD>
potato and tomato varieties may differ in their response to various herbicides. dupont recommends that you first consult
your state experiment station, university, or extension agent as to sensitivity to any herbicide. if no information is
available, limit the initial use to a small area.
preemergence use on soils containing more than 6% organic matter may not provide adequate soil residual weed control
and may result in reduced weed control.
preemergence and postemergence use on rill irrigated potatoes and tomatoes (furrow or gravity) may not provide
adequate weed control in the absence of rainfall.
if sprinklers are used for frost protection, delay the application of matrix® sg until stress from environmental
conditions have passed.
avoid spray drift to any adjacent crops or desirable plants as injury may occur.
crop injury may occur following an application of matrixo sg if there is a prolonged period
of
cold
weather
and/or
cold weather in conjunction with wet soils caused by poor drainage or excessive use of sprinkler irrigation for frost
protection.
draining or flushing equipment on or near desirable trees or other plants, or in areas where their roots may extend, or in
locations where the chemical may be washed or moved into contact with their roots may injure these plants. trees or
other desirable plants whose roots extend into a treated crop use area may be injured.
carefully observe sprayer cleanup instructions, as spray tank residue may damage other crops.
for best results, maintain spray tank solution at ph 5 to 7.
3
if the selected companion herbicide has a ground or surface water advisory, consider the advisory when using the {['TITLE EXTRACT']}
companion herbicide.
tank mixing duponttm matrix® sg with organophosphate insecticides in tomatoes may result in crop injury.
naturally occurring weed biotypes that are resistant to duponttm ally herbicide, dupont™ glean fc herbicide,
duponttm express herbicide, duponttm harmony extra herbicide, or duponttm finesse® herbicide will
also be resistant to matrix sg (refer to weed resistance management section)
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 4)>restrictions</BOLD>
do not apply more than 4 ounces (0.0625 lb ai) matrix® sg per acre per year. refer to table 1 and the application
information section for each crop/crop group for specific use restrictions.
injury to or loss of desirable trees or vegetation may result from failure to observe the following:
do not apply, drain, or flush equipment on or near desirable trees or other plants, or on areas where their roots may
-
extend, or in locations where the chemical may be washed or moved into contact with their roots.
- do not use on lawns, walks, driveways, tennis courts, or similar areas. prevent drift of spray to desirable plants.
- do not contaminate any body of water, including irrigation water that may be used on other crops.
do not apply to frozen or snow covered soil. crop injury may occur from applications made to poorly drained soils.
do not apply using air assisted (air blast) field crop sprayers.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 4)>weed resistance management</BOLD>
matrix® sg, which contains the active ingredient rimsulfuron, is a group 2 herbicide based on the mode of action classification
system of the weed science society of america.
proactively implementing diversified weed control strategies to minimize selection for weed populations resistant to one or more
herbicides is a best practice. a diversified weed management program may include the use of multiple herbicides with different sites
of action and overlapping weed spectrum with or without tillage operations and/or other cultural practices. research has
demonstrated that using the labeled rate and directions for use is important to delay the selection for resistance.
the continued effectiveness of this product depends on the successful implementation of a weed resistance management program.
to aid in the prevention of developing weeds resistant to this product, users should:
scout fields before application to ensure herbicides and rates will be appropriate for the weed species and weed sizes present.
start with a clean field, using either a burndown herbicide application or tillage.
control weeds early when they are relatively small (less than 4 inches).
apply full rates of matrix sg for the most difficult to control weed in the field at the specified time (correct weed size) to
minimize weed escapes.
scout fields after application to detect weed escapes or shifts in control of weed species.
control weed escapes before they reproduce by seed or proliferate vegetatively.
report any incidence of non-performance of this product against a particular weed to your dupont representative, local retailer, or
county extension agent.
contact your dupont representative, crop advisor, or extension agent to find out if suspected resistant weeds to this moa have
been found in your region. if resistant biotypes of target weeds have been reported, use the application rates of this product
specified for your local conditions. tank mix products so that there are multiple effective sites of actions for each target weed.
if resistance is suspected, treat weed escapes with an herbicide having a site of action other than group 2 and/or use nonchemical
methods to remove escapes, as practical, with the goal of preventing further seed production.
suspected herbicide-resistant weeds may be identified by these indicators:
failure to control a weed species normally controlled by the herbicide at the dose applied, especially if control is achieved on
adjacent weeds;
a spreading patch of non-controlled plants of a particular weed species; and
surviving plants mixed with controlled individuals of the same species.
additionally, users should follow as many of the following herbicide resistance management practices as is practical:
use a broad spectrum soil-applied herbicide with other sites of action as a foundation in a weed control program.
utilize sequential applications of herbicides with alternative sites of action.
rotate the use of this product with non-group 2 herbicides.
avoid making more than two applications of matrix® sg and any other group 2 herbicides within a single growing season
unless mixed with an herbicide with a different site of action with an overlapping spectrum for the difficult-to-control weeds.

incorporate non-chemical weed control practices, including mechanical cultivation, crop rotation, cover crops and weed-free crop {['TITLE EXTRACT']}
seeds, as part of an integrated weed control program.
use good agronomic principles that enhance crop development and crop competitiveness.
thoroughly clean plant residues from equipment before leaving fields suspected to contain resistant weeds.
manage weeds in and around fields, during and after harvest to reduce weed seed production.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 5)>integrated pest management</BOLD>
this product may be used as part of an integrated pest management (ipm) program, which can include biological, cultural, and
genetic practices, aimed at preventing economic pest damage. application of this product should be based on ipm principles and
practices including field scouting or other detection methods, correct target pest identification, population monitoring, and treating
when target pest populations reach locally determined action thresholds. consult your state cooperative extension service,
professional consultants or other qualified authorities to determine appropriate action treatment threshold levels for treating specific
pest/crop or site systems in your area.

<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 5)>controlling droplet size-ground boom</BOLD>
volume - increasing the spray volume so that larger droplets are produced will reduce spray drift. use the highest practical
spray volume for the application. if a greater spray volume is needed, consider using a nozzle with a higher flow rate.

drift.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 6)>controlling droplet size - aircraft</BOLD>
adjust nozzles - follow nozzle manufacturers specifications for setting up nozzles. generally, to reduce fine droplets,
nozzles should be oriented parallel with the airflow in flight.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 6)>boomheight-ground - boom</BOLD>

<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 6)>shielded sprayers</BOLD>
shielding the boom or individual nozzles can reduce spray drift. consider using shielded sprayers. verify that the shields are
not interfering with the uniform deposition of the spray on the target area.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 6)>temperature and humidity</BOLD>
when making applications in hot and dry conditions, use larger droplets to reduce effects of evaporation.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 6)>temperature inversions</BOLD>
drift potential is high during a temperature inversion. temperature inversions are characterized by increasing temperature with
altitude and are common on nights with limited cloud cover and light to no wind. the presence of an inversion can be indicated
by ground fog or by the movement of smoke from a ground source or an aircraft smoke generator. smoke that layers and
moves laterally in a concentrated cloud (under low wind conditions) indicates an inversion, while smoke that moves upward
and rapidly dissipates indicates good vertical air mixing. avoid applications during temperature inversions.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 6)>wind</BOLD>
drift potential generally increases with wind speed. avoid applications during gusty wind conditions.
applicators need to be familiar with local wind patterns and terrain that could affect spray drift.
drift control additives
using product compatible drift control additives can reduce drift potential. when a drift control additive is used, read and
carefully observe cautionary statements and all other information on the additive's label. if using an additive that increases
viscosity, ensure that the nozzles and other application equipment will function properly with a viscous spray solution.
preferred drift control additives have been certified by the chemical producers and distributors association (cpda).
tank mixtures
to broaden the weed control spectrum and/o extend the residual effectiveness of duponttm matrix sg herbicide,
matrix® sg may be tank mixed with other registered herbicides affecting a different site of action (mode of action) and /or
adjuvants registered for use on the crops listed on matrix® sg labeling.
it is the pesticide user's responsibility to ensure that all products are registered for the intended use. read and follow the applicable
restrictions and limitations and directions for use on all product labels involved in tank mixing. users must follow the most
restrictive directions for use and precautionary statements of each product in the tank mixture.

application information
apply dupont™ matrixo sg as a uniform broadcast application to the orchard or vineyard floor or as a uniform band
application directed at the base of the trunk or vine.
for broadcast applications, make a single application of matrix® sg at 4 ounces (0.0625 lb ai) per acre per year. for
improved weed management, matrix® sg should be applied in tank mixture with other registered preemergence
herbicides.
matrix® sg may be applied twice per acre per year as a banded treatment preemergence or postemergence at the 4
ounces (0.0625 lb ai) of product rate, per conventional broadcast acre, at 50% banding or less. see below to calculate actual
treated area when using band applications.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 9)>band width (inches) x rate per broadcast acre = amount matrix® sg band applied per acre</BOLD>
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 9)>row width (inches)</BOLD>
to help ensure uniform coverage, use a minimum of 10 gallons of spray solution per acre. nozzle selection must meet
manufacture's spray volume and pressure instructions for preemergence or postemergence herbicide applications.
apply only to crops that have been established for one full growing season and are in good health and vigor.
best results are obtained when the soil is moist at the time of application, and 1/2 inch of rainfall or sprinkler irrigation
occurs within 2 weeks after application. time the application(s) to take advantage of normal rainfall patterns and cool
temperatures. moisture for activation should occur within 2-3 weeks after application.
matrix® sg may also be applied by certain chemigation methods, including micro-sprinkler. however, do not apply by
overhead, flood, or drip irrigation.

rainfall or irrigation is needed for herbicide activation. length of control is a function of moisture for activation, soil
temperature, soil texture and amount of moisture after application.
when weeds are present at application, include a labeled burn down herbicide, including glyphosate, paraquat, or
glufosinate, with an appropriate adjuvant. matrix® sg will help provide postemergence control of the weeds listed in
this label. for best results, make postemergence applications to young, actively growing weeds and include a spray
adjuvant.
residual weed control may be reduced when matrix® sg is applied where where heavy crop trash and/or weed residue
exists. weed control may also be reduced when applications of matrix® sg are made to weeds under stress from
drought, excessive water, temperature extremes, disease or low humidity.

<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 10)>specific weed problems< HEADING />
common dandelion and mallow: duponttm matrix® sg provides excellent preemergence control of
common dandelion and mallow germinating from seed. in high rainfall areas or where sprinkler irrigation is used, a second
application may be needed to extend residual control throughout the growing season. when applications are made
postemergence to these weeds, always add a suitable burndown herbicide (e.g., glyphosate or paraquat). small and
medium sized plants (up to 6 inches in diameter) are controlled by postemergence applications of matrix® sg plus a
burndown herbicide; however, plants that are larger than 6 inches in diameter may only be suppressed and may require a
second application 4 to 6 weeks later.
marestail and fleabane: where marestail and fleabane are the target weeds, applications prior to emergence
provide best results. this may require a fall application to help prevent fall germinated seedlings from becoming
established during the winter. a foliar active herbicide with activity on fleabane and marestail (e.g., paraquat, glyphosate,
and/or glufosinate) must be tank mixed with matrix® sg for best control and resistance management. after fall
application, a second application in the spring may be required to provide extended weed control into the summer. where
matrix® sg is applied for control of marestail and fleabane, it is also recommended that another soil residual herbicide
be included as a tank mix or rotational partner to aid in resistance management.
puncturevine: for best results, apply early in the spring when you can expect rainfall or overhead irrigation to move
matrix® sg into the weed root zone before puncturevine germinates. puncturevine emerges over a long period of time
and late season germinations may not be controlled.
10
yellow nutsedge: duponttm matrix® sg provides suppression of yellow nutsedge. to obtain the most
effective results, use the highest rate allowed based on the width of your spray band and make two applications. for
applications made postemergence to nutsedge, always add the appropriate rate of a glyphosate product and an effective {['TITLE EXTRACT']}
adjuvant. on soils with high organic matter (6% or higher) always apply postemergence to weeds since preemergence
applications are not as effective on these soils.
<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 11)>application timing - yellow nutsedge< HEADING />
preemergence plus early postemergence: make the preemergence application when you can expect rainfall or overhead
irrigation to move matrix® sg into the nutsedge root zone prior to nutsedge emergence. make a second application
when emerging nutsedge is 2 to 4 inches tall. postemergence plus second postemergence: make first application when
emerging nutsedge is 2 to 4 inches tall. repeat application 14 days later. note: if yellow nutsedge is greater than 6 inches
tall at the first application, weed control effectiveness will be greatly reduced.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 11)>annual summer grasses (including barnyardgrass, green foxtail, and crabgrass): where sprinkler irrigation</BOLD>
is used, a fall or early spring application of matrix® sg will not provide season-long control of summer grasses like
foxtail, barnyardgrass and crabgrass. for best results, use matrix® sg with a suitable tank-mix herbicide containing one
of the following active ingredients; indaziflam ("alion"), flumioxazin ("chateau"), oxyfluorfen ("goal", "goaltender"),
oryzalin or pendimethalin. a second application may be needed to provide extended control of summer grasses.
diuron containing products (washington and oregon): on coarse textured soils where crops are grown under sprinkler
irrigation, avoid using diuron containing products as a tank-mix partner with matrix® sg between june 1 and
september 30 since crop injury may result. matrix® sg tank-mixed with diuron products (including "karmex" df or
"direx" 4l) can be used in the fall (after september 30), or early spring when temperatures are cool to moderate.
crop rotation - fruit, nut, and vine crops
restriction: do not plant any crops, except field corn, tomatoes, potatoes, and those listed on this label in table 1,
within one year of the last matrix® sg application.
prior to planting, fields to be rotated to the above crops should have a thorough soil mixing - for example, two diskings, or
a plowing and a disking. to help ensure rotational crop safety, a field bioassay should be completed prior to planting any
other desired crops. the results of this bioassay may require the crop rotation interval to be extended. a successful field
bioassay means growing to maturity a test strip of the crop(s) intended for production. the test strip should cross the entire
field including knolls and low areas.
micro-sprinkler chemigation - fruit, nut, and vine crops
matrix® sg may be applied via micro-sprinkler chemigation. the chemigation system must contain a functional check
valve, vacuum relief valve, and low pressure drain appropriately located on the irrigation pipeline to prevent water source
contamination from backflow. the pesticide injection pipeline must contain a functional, automatic, quick-closing check
valve to prevent the flow of fluid back toward the injection pump. the pesticide injection pipeline must also contain a
functional (normally closed) solenoid-operated valve located on the intake side of the injection pump and connected to the
system interlock to prevent fluid from being withdrawn from the supply tank when the irrigation system is either
automatically or manually shut down. the system must contain functional interlocking controls to automatically shut off
the pesticide injection pump when the water pump motor stops. the irrigation line or water pump must include a functional
pressure switch which will stop the water pump motor when the water pressure decreases to the point where pesticide
distribution is adversely affected. systems must use a metering pump, including a positive displacement injection pump
(e.g., diaphragm pump) effectively designed and constructed of materials that are compatible with pesticide(s) and capable
of being fitted with a system interlock.
use restrictions for chemigation - fruit, nut, and vine crops
when applying matrix® sg via chemigation to these crops, use micro-sprinkler equipment only.
do not connect an irrigation system used for matrix® sg herbicide application to a public water system.
do not permit run-off during chemigation.
use precautions for chemigation- fruit, nut, and vine crops
distributing treated water in an uneven manner can result in crop injury, lack of effectiveness, or over-tolerance pesticide
residues in the crop. therefore, to ensure that the mixture is applied evenly at the labeled rate, use sufficient water, apply
the mixture for the proper length of time and ensure sprinkler produces a uniform water pattern.
continuous agitation in the mix tank is needed to keep the product from settling. if settling does occur, thoroughly agitate
the tank mixture before using.

<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 12)>grass grown for seed (oregon, washington) {['TITLE EXTRACT']}< HEADING />
<HEADING (PAGE NUMBER = 12)>application information< HEADING />
use duponttm matrix® sg only in conjunction with carbon planted perennial ryegrass and tall fescue grown for seed.
the activated carbon band over the seed row absorbs matrix® sg so that seedling grass germinating beneath the carbon
band is protected from the herbicide. the protection provided by the carbon band is only as good as the width and integrity
of the band.
heavy and/or persistent rains after planting can cause deterioration of the carbon band allowing matrix® sg to move
into the grass root zone causing injury and/or stand loss. standing water can also increase the risk of matrix® sg
moving vertically through the carbon band or laterally beneath the band.
variability in seedbed preparation, and unpredictable environmental conditions, including heavy rain, can compromise the
protection provided by the carbon band. therefore, to the extent consistent with applicable law, the grower assumes all
risks of crop injury and/or stand loss associated with the use of matrix® sg.
apply matrixo sg with properly calibrated ground equipment with good mechanical or by-pass agitation. only apply
matrix® sg on early fall planted fields (refer to use precautions section) that have been prepared with a smooth, fine
seedbed that is firmly packed prior to planting.
during the planting operation, apply activated carbon at the label directed rate as long as that rate is not lower than 300 lbs
per acre. apply the activated carbon in a band at least 1.0 inch wide centered over the seed row. use a minimum spray
volume of 40 gallons per acre to apply the activated carbon.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 12)>weeds controlled - grass grown for seed</BOLD>
in the area outside of the carbon band, matrix® sg will provide control of seedling annual bluegrass, annual and
perennial ryegrass, volunteer wheat, and roughstock bluegrass.
note: certain biotypes of diuron resistant annual bluegrass have shown reduced sensitivity to matrix® sg and may not
be adequately controlled. where these biotypes are known to exist, apply matrix®sg in a tank-mix with "kerb" sc, a
pronamide containing herbicide.
some biotypes of annual bluegrass that are resistant to other herbicides have also shown reduced sensitivity to matrix®
sg. where these biotypes are present, matrix® sg used alone will only provide suppression.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 12)>tank mixes with other herbicides</BOLD>
matrix® sg can be applied in a tank-mix with other pre-emergence herbicides, including "kerb sc or a diuron

do not make more than 2 applications of matrix sg per year.
do not exceed 2.5 ounces (0.0391 lb ai) matrix® sg per acre per year.
do not apply to sweet potatoes or yams.
do not apply to potatoes growing in greenhouses, cold frames, pot cultures, etc. apply only to potatoes growing in
fields.
pre-emergence application
for best results, apply matrix® sg at 1 to 1.5 ounces (0.0156-0.0234 lb ai) product per acre, immediately after hilling,
drag-off, or reservoir tillage (dam/dike operation), to a clean, newly prepared seedbed.
to activate matrix® sg in the soil, supply moisture by a single rainfall event, or apply sprinkler irrigation of 1/3 to 1"
(sandy soils apply at least 1/3", sandy loams apply at least 1/2", silt soils apply at least 3/4", clay soils apply at least 1"),
within 5 days after application, to move matrix® sg 2 to 3" deep into the soil profile. activating sprinkler irrigation is
required regardless of the soil moisture level at planting, or the cumulative precipitation that occurs over the next 5 days
(unless rainfall occurs in a single event and equals the activation moisture requirement). if rainfall or sprinkler activation
cannot be managed, waiting for weeds to emerge and applying matrix® sg postemergence would result in better weed
control.
if a clean, newly prepared seedbed, free of emerged or germinating weeds does not occur, and weeds are present at
application, add a spray adjuvant to the spray mix (see the "spray adjuvant" section of this label for additional
information). control may not be adequate for weeds that have an established root system before activation of matrix®
sg.
tank mixtures - preemergence applications
matrix® sg may be tank mixed with pesticide products labeled for use on potatoes, including "eptam" 7e (eptc),
"prowl" (pendamethalin), "lorox" df (linuron), cinchr or "dual ii magnum"(s-metolachor), roundup" or glyphosate-
containing products registered for potatoes, in accordance with the most restrictive of label limitations and precautions.
matrix® sg may also be used in three-way tank mix combinations with the above pesticide(s). if these instructions
conflict with this matrix® sg label, do not use as a tank mix with matrix® sg.
it is the pesticide user's responsibility to ensure that all products are registered for the intended use. read and follow the

sequential applications - potatoes
depending upon rainfall or other environmental conditions, and the density of the top growth of the potato variety (those with
poor top growth including norkotah), annual weeds may have a second flush of germinating seedlings, and treated perennials
may produce new growth from underground roots or stems. to maximize control of such weeds, it may be necessary to apply
matrix® sg a second time, 14 to 28 days after the first application (typically, make applications to small weeds that are less
than 1" in height or diameter that are actively growing). restrictions: make no more than 2 applications, and the combined rate
of the applications cannot exceed 2.5 ounces (0.0391 lb ai) matrix® sg per acre.

aerial application
(alsoread spray driftmanagement section)
- use nozzle types and arrangements that will provide optimum spray distribution and maximum coverage at a minimum of 5
gpa. in california use a minimum of 10 gpa.
aerial application restrictions:
- do not apply during a temperature inversion, when winds are gusty, or when conditions favor poor coverage and/or off-target
spray movement.

chemigation - potatoes only
dupont™ matrix® sg can be applied using center pivot, lateral move, solid set, or hand move irrigation systems in
potatoes. do not apply matrix® sg using any other type of irrigation system. check irrigation systems to insure uniform
application of water to all areas. failure to apply matrix® sg uniformly may result in crop injury and/or poor weed control.
for best results, use the highest labeled rate and apply preemergence to early postemergence to the weeds (weeds less than 1"
tall). if weeds are present at application, add a nonionic surfactant containing at least 80% active ingredient to the spray mix at
1 to 2 pt/acre.
matrix® sg may be mixed in a supply tank with water, fertilizer, or other appropriate agricultural chemicals. maintain
continuous agitation in the injection nurse tanks during application.
for solid set and hand move irrigation systems, apply matrix sg at the beginning of the set and then apply 1/3 to 1" of
water for activation (sandy soils apply at least 1/3", sandy loams apply at least 1/2", silt soils apply at least 3/4", clay soils
apply at least 1").
for center pivot and lateral move irrigation systems, apply matrix sg in 1/3 to 1" of water for activation as a continuous
injection (sandy soils apply at least 1/3", sandy loams apply at least 1/2", silt soils apply at least 3/4", clay soils apply at least
1").
if you have questions about calibrating chemigation equipment, contact state extension service specialists, equipment
manufacturers, or other experts. if the chemigation equipment needs adjustment, only the custodian responsible for its
operation, or someone under the supervision of that custodian, can make the necessary adjustments.
irrigation system requirements
the irrigation system must contain the following:
a functional check valve
vacuumreliefvalve
a low pressure drain (to prevent water source contamination from backflow; must be located on the irrigation pipeline)
functional interlocking controls (to automatically shut-off the pesticide injection pump when the water pump motor stops)
metering pump, including a positive displacement injection pump (e.g., diaphragm pump) effectively designed and
a
constructed of materials that are compatible with pesticides and capable of being fitted with a system interlock
the pesticide injection pipeline must contain the following:
a functional, automatic, quick-closing check valve (to prevent the flow of fluid back toward the injection pump)
a functional, solenoid-operated valve (normally closed) located on the intake side of the injection pump (should be connected
to the system interlock to prevent fluid from being withdrawn from the supply tank when the irrigation system is shut down
either automatically or manually)
the irrigation line or water pump must include a functional pressure switch that will stop the water pump motor when pesticide
distribution is adversely affected by a decrease in water pressure.
use precautions for chemigation-potatoes
distributing treated water in an uneven manner can result in crop injury, lack of effectiveness, or over-tolerance pesticide
residues in the crop. therefore, to ensure that the mixture is applied evenly at the labeled rate, use sufficient water, and apply
the mixture for the proper length of time.
use restrictions for chemigation -potatoes
do not permit run-off during chemigation.
do not apply when wind speed favors drift beyond the area intended for treatment.
do not connect an irrigation system (including greenhouse systems) used for matrix® sg application to a public water
system.
matrix®sg rotational crop restrictions - potato
for crops listed below, planting prior to the interval shown may result in crop injury when using matrix® sg. rotation
intervals may need to be extended to 18 months if drought conditions prevail after application and before the rotational crop is

note: where drip irrigated tomatoes are grown, rotate only to tomato, potato or field corn as crop injury may result.
rotational crops may be planted at indicated intervals provided the fields are deep disked or plowed, and thorough soil mixing
is achieved, prior to planting the rotational crop.
cultivation
a timely cultivation may be necessary to control suppressed weeds, weeds that were beyond the maximum size at application,
or weeds that emerge after an application of matrix® sg.
cultivation up to 7 days before the postemergence application of matrix® sg may decrease weed control by pruning
weed roots, placing the weeds under stress, or covering the weeds with soil and preventing coverage by matrix® sg.
to allow matrix® sg to fully control treated weeds, cultivation is not advised for 7 days after application.
optimum timing for cultivation is 7 - 14 days after a postemergence application of matrix® sg.
spray adjuvants
include a spray adjuvant with applications of matrix® sg when applied by itself and postemergence to the weeds. consult
your ag dealer or applicator, local dupont fact sheets, technical bulletins, and service policies prior to using an adjuvant
system. if another herbicide is tank mixed with matrix® sg, select adjuvants authorized for use with both products.
products must contain only epa-exempt ingredients (40 cfr 1001).
nonionic surfactant (nis)
apply 0.125 to 0.25% v/v (1 to 2 pt/100 gal of water). the 0.25% v/v rate is preferred under arid or drought conditions.
surfactant products must contain at least 80% nonionic surfactant with a hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (hlb) greater than
12.
petroleum crop oil concentrate (coc) or modified seed oil (mso)
apply at 1% volume/volume (1 gal per 100 gal spray solution), or 2% under arid conditions.
oil adjuvants must contain at least 80% high quality, petroleum (mineral) or modified vegetable seed oil with at least 15%
surfactant emulsifiers.
blended products which contain both mso and silcone are acceptable at labeled rates.
ammonium nitrogen fertilizer
use 2 qt/acre of a high-quality urea ammonium nitrate (uan), including 28%n or 32%n, or 2 lb/acre of a spray grade
ammonium sulfate (ams). use 4 qt/acre uan or 4 lb/acre ams under arid conditions.
do not use liquid nitrogen fertilizer as the total carrier solution.
special adjuvant types
combination adjuvant products may be used at doses that provide the required amount of nis and ammonium nitrogen
fertilizer. consult product literature for use rates and restrictions.
22
at
do not use any other adjuvant rates or mixtures with duponttm matrix® sg unless instructed to do so on dupont
technical bulletins.
<BOLD (PAGE NUMBER = 23)>precautions:</BOLD>
1. the use of silicone polymer type surfactants is not suggested as reduced weed control may result.
2. avoid using crop oil concentrate (coc) or methylated seed oil (mso) when potatoes are under heat stress (>85 degrees f)
as multiple stresses may cause crop injury.
equipment-spray volumes
agitate the spray tank continuously to keep the material in suspension.
do not use equipment and/or spray volumes that will cause damage from spray by drift onto nontarget sites. do not make
applications when weather conditions are likely to cause spray to drift onto nontarget sites. (see the "spray drift management"
section of this label for additional information).
ground application-potatoes and tomatoes
to ensure optimum spray distribution and thorough coverage, apply matrix® sg with a properly calibrated, low-pressure
(20 to 40 psi) boom sprayer equipped with flat fan, "twinjet", underleaf banding nozzles or flood jet nozzles. nozzle screens
must be no finer than 50 mesh. when using flood nozzles, the spray pattern should overlap 100% for optimum product
performance. for banded applications even flow flat fan or twin jet spray nozzles may provide a more uniform spray
distribution.
with ground application equipment, use enough water to deliver 10 to 40 gal total spray solution per acre. avoid overlapping,
and shut off spray booms while starting, turning, slowing, or stopping, or injury to the crop may result.
sprayer cleanup
spray equipment or nurse tanks used in chemigation, must be cleaned before matrix® sg is sprayed. follow the cleanup
procedures specified on the labels of previously applied products. if no directions are provided, follow the 6 steps outlined in
the "after applying matrix® sg and before applying to other crops" section of this label.
for maximum preemergence activity, prior to application, the bed or soil surface should be smooth and relatively free of crop and
weed trash (dead weeds, decaying leaves, clippings, etc.). leaves and trash may be removed by blowing the area to be treated or by
thoroughly mixing the trash into the soil through cultivation prior to herbicide application. cultural practices that result in
redistribution or disturbance of the soil surface after treatment will decrease the herbicidal effectiveness of matrix® sg. cutting
water furrows, or cultivations that mix untreated soil into the treated areas, will also reduce the effectiveness of the herbicide
treatment.
for best weed management apply matrix® sg with another suitable residual herbicide registered for that crop. this is
recommended for all soil types, but especially so for coarse textured soils under standard sprinklers or micro-sprinklers.
more than one banded application of matrix® sg may be needed to provide extended weed control.

application information
matrix® sg is a selective herbicide for burndown and residual control of certain annual grass and broadleaf weeds
weeds when applied fallow, preemergence and postemergence to field corn. matrix® sg may be applied in tank mix
combinations with other corn herbicides for improved burndown and residual control. residual weed control is dependent
on rainfall, sprinkler irrigation, flood irrigation or furrow irrigation for herbicide activation. furrow irrigation may not
provide proper activation on tops of beds if rainfall or furrow irrigation does not drive matrix® sg into the soil and
weed root zones.
matrix® sg is absorbed through the roots and leaf tissue of plants, rapidly inhibiting the growth of susceptible weeds.
rainfall or sprinkler irrigation is needed to move matrix® sg into the soil. susceptible weeds will generally not emerge
from a preemergence application. in some cases, susceptible weeds may germinate and emerge a few days after application,
but growth then ceases and leaves become chlorotic three to five days after emergence. death of leaf tissue and growing
point will follow in some species, while others will remain green, stunted and noncompetitive.
the herbicidal action of matrix® sg may be less effective on weeds stressed from adverse environmental conditions
(including extreme temperatures or moisture), abnormal soil conditions, or cultural practices.
matrix® sg treatments are most effective in controlling weeds when adequate rainfall or irrigation is received 5 -7 days
after application. if cultivation is necessary because of soil crusting, soil compaction or weed germination before rain or
irrigation occurs, use shallow tillage, such as a rotary hoe, to lightly incorporate matrix® sg and make certain corn
seeds are below the tilled area.
matrix® sg is best used in a planned sequential application herbicide program, to be followed by an in-crop application
of matrix® sg, and/or other post applied corn herbicides. refer to the label of the respective sequential partner for
specific use directions.
23
allow at least 4 weeks between preemergence applications of dupont matrix® sg and postemergence applications of {['TITLE EXTRACT']}
matrix® sg.
make sequential applications after the corn has reached the 2-collar stage but before the corn exceeds the maximum
application height listed on the respective product labels.
avoid making preemergence applications to coarse-textured soils (sand, loamy sand or sandy loam) with less than 1%
organic matter as crop injury may occur.
apply matrixo sg to field corn hybrids with a relative maturity (rm) of 77 days or more, including "food grade"
(yellow dent, hard endosperm), waxy and high-oil corn. not all field corn hybrids of less than 77 days rm, not all white
corn hybrids nor hi-lysine hybrids have been tested for crop safety, nor does dupont have access to all seed company
data.
consequently, to the extent consistent with applicable law, injury arising from the use of matrix® sg on these types of
corn is the responsibility of the user. consult with your seed supplier before applying matrix® sg to any of these corn
types. seed company publications indicate "warning", "crop response warning", or "sensitive" notations for the use of
some als herbicides on corn hybrids of 77 crm or higher. as noted in the seed company publications, dupont
sulfonylurea herbicides including matrix® sg should be used with caution on these hybrids. consult with your local
dupont representative or the dupont label web site (http://cropprotection.dupont.com/) for any additional supplemental
labeling information relative to potential corn hybrid sensitivity to matrix® sg.
