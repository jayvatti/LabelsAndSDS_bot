For residual weed\ncontrol or to broaden the weed control spectrum, tank mix this product\nwith other herbicides. It is the pesticide user's responsibility to ensure\nthat all products are registered for the intended use. Read and follow the\napplicable restrictions and limitations and directions for use on all product\nlabels involved in tank mixing. Users must follow the most restrictive\ndirections for use and precautionary statements of each product in the\ntank mixture. A compatibility test may be done prior to using a product\nthat has not been tank mixed before with Accord XRT Il in your program.\nSee testing procedure below.\nThe user is responsible for ensuring that the specific application being\nmade is included on the label of the product used in the tank mix and\nis compatible with Accord XRT II, especially if using a generic product\nwith active ingredients, such as 2,4-D, atrazine, dicamba, diuron,\npendimethalin or other herbicide, is listed in the label.\nAdd the tank mix product to the tank as directed by the label.

Keep the bypass line on or near the\nbottom of the tank to minimize foaming. The screen size in the nozzle or\nline strainers must be no finer than 50 mesh.\nTank Mix Compatibility Testing: Perform a jar test prior to mixing in a\nspray tank to ensure compatibility of Accord XRT II and other pesticides\nor carriers. Use a clear glass jar with lid and mix ingredients in the same\norder and proportions as will be used in the spray tank. The mixture is\ncompatible if the materials mix readily when the jar is inverted several\ntimes. The mixture should remain stable after standing for 1/2 hour or,\nif separation occurs, should readily remix if agitated. An incompatible\nmixture is indicated by separation into distinct layers that do not readily\nremix when agitated and/or the presence of flakes, precipitates, gels,\nor heavy oily film in the jar. Use of an appropriate compatibility aid may\nresolve mix incompatibility. If the mixture is incompatible do not use that\ntank mix partner in tank mixtures.\nNote: If tank mixing with a product containing triclopyn amine, such as\nGarlon\u00ae 3A herbicide or Capstone, ensure that the triclopyr amine product\nis well mixed with at least 75 percent of the total spray volume before\nadding this product to the spray tank to avoid incompatibility.\nTo the extent consistent with applicable law, buyer and all users are\nresponsible for all loss or damage in connection with the use or handling\nof mixtures of this product with herbicides or other materials that are not\nexpressly specified in this labeling.
